One of the hallmark signs of autism is a child not responding to their name. I know when Lucas was a young child, he would not respond to his name and that was a warning sign of autism. So, I now know, as a behavior analyst, how to teach response to your name.

Why children ignore you
Many parents report that their child used to respond to their name and somehow they have unlearned to do so. We have to think about why youâ€™re calling for your childâ€™s name. Sometimes, parents are calling for their childâ€™s attention for self-serving reasons (donâ€™t worry, we all do this). Once we get their attention, we look at how cute they are and thatâ€™s it. Slowly, delayed children who derive no social reward from this interaction will learn that there isnâ€™t really anything in for them and not react to you. I can bet that most children do react to their names when youâ€™re holding their lunch (especially when theyâ€™re hungry).

Other than that, parents are actively teaching children that ignoring is actually acceptable. When you call him once, he ignores and if you keep on repeating his nameâ€¦ What youâ€™re actually teaching is that you can be ignored. So try not to repeat.

Praising and rewarding attention
How then? You might ask. Well, we need to praise and reward whenever he actually does respond to you or look at you. Whenever youâ€™re holding something that is of interest to him, thatâ€™s the perfect time to call his name. 

Set up activities that are fun and call his name to show him different things. Praise him for it, say â€œgood answering meâ€ and tickle him. If he ignores you, you can provide some feedback and say â€œyou didnâ€™t answer meâ€ and you donâ€™t have to repeat yourself. The more times she gets a good experience from responding to her name, the more likely itâ€™ll happen. Donâ€™t push it.

Avoid artificial attention
Some parents will go as far as to clap their hands, raise their voices, speaking in a higher tone or make silly sounds. Thatâ€™s teaching your child to look paired with those cues. You cannot do this all day, and itâ€™s certainly not something that can be easier faded away. Stick to your normal way of calling then praise and reward whenever do get his attention. Remember, always think about whatâ€™s in for your child in the beginning. Once itâ€™s a pleasant experience attending to you, it will happen naturally.

There are a surprising number of professionals and schools who have an autism eye contact training program. But I really donâ€™t think thatâ€™s a great idea to start focusing on such a skill, especially when there are a number of other important skills we should be focusing on. In todayâ€™s video Iâ€™m going to explain my reasoning behind and this, but also provide some tips for improving eye contact for children with autism. We obviously donâ€™t want to be forcing eye contact on the child, but there are some tweaks you can make to your parenting and teaching strategies to have a minor focus on eye contact.

A big warning sign of autism can be decreased eye contact.  When you call your child's name does he/she look at you? Or do you have to call her name many times?  Does your child seem to almost be in their own world?  Eye contact is one of the foundational skills of speech and language development. So if eye contact is decreased â€“ chances are that language skills may also be delayed.

On this video series letâ€™s talk about what you can do as parents and caregivers when you see these signs.

Here are 3 things you can do to increase your child's eye contact:
1) Ask for it and wait;
2) Put a sticker on your nose;
3) Put your hands on the side of your childâ€™s face and bring your face closer.

Try these things with your child at home!

One question that I get asked every now and then, and a question you should be asking yourself is, at what age should a child start pointing? Teaching pointing to children is an important skill, as itâ€™s a milestone for typical developing children. When children with autism donâ€™t point, they tend to resort to what is called hand leading. In todayâ€™s video Iâ€™ll talk a bit about both, types of pointing, how to teach pointing to children, and discuss whether not pointing is a sign of autism. When a child is not point itâ€™s definitely a red flag, but thatâ€™s not to say that he/she has autism.

Main findings were that infants at 12 months whoÂ pointedÂ exclusively with the wholeÂ hand, but never with the conventionalized index-fingerÂ shape, had significantly lowerÂ languageÂ skills and a higher risk forÂ language delayÂ (LD) at 24 months than children who did use the indexÂ fingerÂ forÂ pointingÂ at 12 months.

Play skills development can be difficult in children with autism, especially if they end up becoming stim activities. Play skills are crucial in a childâ€™s leisure skills, but social skills through play can also be developed which help increase language. In general, there are two types of play skills: independent play skills and social play skills. In my experience as a behavior analyst and autism mom, Iâ€™ve often seen other skills developed through play which really show how impactful play skills can be to children with autism.

If youâ€™ve been stuck teaching play skills to your child or client with autism, Iâ€™m confident that some of the strategies I provide in this video can help you make some progress. And if youâ€™re looking for more information or extra help on teaching play to kids with autism, I encourage you to sign up for one of my free workshops. Autism play skills are vital to avoid a child from becoming rote with toys, and helping a child reach their fullest potential to be as independent, happy, and safe as possible.

4,vf8yXrRTXRk,5/21/2021,Joint Attention Skills in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder || Children with Autism,"Children affected with Autism Spectrum disorder do not engage in the world outside of them much and remain immersed in themselves and their object of interest. This can be a grave situation for the parents to handle. To deal with it, the parents should try to attract the attention of the child towards themselves. This can be done by showing the child, their things of interest, getting them engaged in curriculums that they enjoy, and also parents should try to communicate with their child more often. While teaching the child any skills, the parents should appreciate the child's action after they have completed their task. Try to also grab the attention of the child first towards yourself, and then in the object of interest. In this way, a rapport will be built between the child and the parent. 
#SkillsinChildren #AutismSpectrum #Disorder

Following these techniques, the child will start to gradually look up to their parents for gestures of consent. Skills developed in this manner are achievable even for an autistic spectrum disorder child.

HOW TO IMPROVE or INCREASE YOUR CHILD'S ATTENTION SPAN DURING PLAY AT HOME!

 Here are a few different at home speech therapy activities for our late talker toddler friends, modeled with 2 toys (Ring stacker and bubbles) that can be used to INCREASE your child's attention span to an age-appropriate level, targeting those PRE-LINGUISTIC SKILLS! *Skills all children meet before they learn to talk!

What is typical attention span in toddlers?
(How long will a child play or attend to an object or toy without parent interaction)
Answer: 2 times their age in minutes (Ex: 2 years old = 4 minutes, 2.5 years old = 5 min, etc)

Ways to improve toddler attention span:
#1) MAKE IT FUN!!!!! IT's not FUN enough - which is why a child runs away! (OR they don't know yet how fun the activity is - OR the activity is TOO HARD!) 
-quick fix.... make the task EASIER! Model IT! Use quick hand over hand assistance anndd...

#2) BE SILLY!! BE CLUMSY!! Drop the item or put it on your head and sneeze it off, or play ""where did it go?!""

#3) Add onto your already developed play routine (like completing a puzzle) - by adding a quick, fun, reinforcer! (Like a BELL!) DING! Kids love hitting a bell when they complete a task and then be sure to be SUPER HAPPY for them that they did it! Now see how many times they can complete the puzzle or how FAST they can do it all the way through - 3 times in a row!

#4) Incorporate gross and fine motor skills into the activity - ADD in a RUN! or a crawl, or a roll BEFORE we hit the bell! Amp up those gross and fine motor skills to get the body regulated and able to process information more efficiently!

#5) Sensory Integration: Use sensory objects during your PLAY! Add in play-dough, kinetic sand, regular sand, shaving cream, orbeez, rice sensory box/bean sensory box, perler beads, shredded paper, cotton balls, pom poms, water, the list goes on and on!  
//BRAND NEW VIDEO ""How to make a SENSORY BOX for LESS than $20!: https://youtu.be/vkd4gvHj3Kc

#6) Drag out a play routine by incorporating a TUNNEL (Buy here: https://amzn.to/3tYl9h3) or a run or a scavenger hunt / search and find game for the pieces to make a regular play routine even more fun, engaging and longer! Drag out a normal play routine such as bubbles by adding in prompts, pauses, requests, etc!

YOU CAN DO IT!! :) 

// Additional tips: Limit i-pad and screen time and increase play, helping mommy or grandma with chores/daily routines, cooking, putting clothes away, etc!! Interaction is key!

Accidentally missed the cards that popped up?!
No worries! They are right here!

NOTE--

Cognitive empathy: the ability to understand how a person feels without necessarily â€œresonatingâ€ with that feeling state.

Affective empathy: the ability to share the feelings of another person (i.e., ""your pain in my heart"").

Compassionate empathy: the ability to go beyond simply sharing their feelings - it actually moves us to take action and to help however we can. 

Somatic empathy: having a physical reaction in response to what someone else is experiencing.",2940,132,0,13

5,rsLJHe5_qi8,5/25/2021,Psychopath Or Autistic - Do Autistic People Have Empathy?,"What is the difference between Autism & Psychopathy? Do Autistic people feel Empathy? What are the two main types of empathy? 

In this video, I'll be explaining the two main types of empathy: Cognitive Empathy & Adaptive Empathy - detailing how these relate to Autism or Psychopathy, and giving you some examples of deficiencies in each type of empathy!

*Autistic people are generally born with lower innate abilities to use cognitive empathy, but just like most things in life... many people can work on developing this skill

I'd like to clarify a few things: 

1. There are many cases where autistic people may not understand a person's situation or emotions due to lack of that personal experience. With proper time, processing and clear explanations, they are likely to empathise once they understand.

2. There can be cases where autistic people have their own set of moral codes/rules for living, which may not be considered moral or lawful by the majority of society. Some autistic people never recover from trauma/isolation, and so develop jaded views of the world and people - this can lead to a learnt disconnection, and may lead them to act on unlawful desires.

3. Sometimes autistic people can go into meltdown, when stressed, anxious or pressured enough. Some autistic people can display outburst of anger, and this may lead to abusive behaviour in some cases.

I think it's important to emphasize that if you are being physically abused by any partner/relation, it's very important that you seek help - abuse is abuse, no matter if they are autistic or not. 

If they are verbally/emotionally abusive, this may be a result of crossed wires or unhealthy methods of communicating your feelings to each other. It's always important to stress that many neurotypicals struggle with communicating with, and understanding autistic people - but this goes both ways in an equal relationship. Work needs to be done to bridge those gaps and make a relationship healthy and functional.

Just as with everyone in this world, autistic people can be abusive, narcissistic and toxic. This video is meant to address the MAJORITY of autistic people - in other cases, although they may not be Psychopathic, autistic people can show both abusive/selfish behaviours.

Children with delayed speech development will oftentimes have weird autism language, as some like to call it. You may say abnormal speech patterns, carrier phrases being used incorrectly, and overgeneralizing words. My number one advice to combat these issues is to avoid using carrier phrases. Additionally, we want to focus on single words, and teaching language as naturally as possible.

Issues like these can arise when we try to teach children how to open a door for example. When the child has learned the phrase â€œopen doorâ€, we may want to teach them how to open a bottle. But instead of saying â€œopen bottleâ€, the child may now again say â€œopen door.â€ This is a classic example, and very similar to something my son Lucas had gone through. This weekâ€™s video blog will review this issue and provide some guidance and tips on how to avoid these incorrect autism speech patterns.

6,fDld7txuKno,8/4/2021,3 Ways To Make Children Speak,"â–ºâ–º Start teaching your child at home. Download my FREE home therapy checklistâ†’ https://www.agentsofspeech.com/checklist

Using bubbles or a strong routine
When teaching a child to speak, we must have something of value. What does that mean? Children will be more likely to interact with you when youâ€™re fun. And the fastest way to achieve that is to use something like bubbles.

By using a desirable object like bubbles, you can create a play routine. Itâ€™s something predictable, fun and what you do over and over.


Teach baby steps towards words
Many skip to teach children to speak words. If it were that easy, the child would have already started to speak themselves! So you should accept gestures and word approximations. What gestures? Teach â€œopenâ€ and â€œblowâ€ if youâ€™re using bubbles. It depends on what your child likes and what activity youâ€™re trying to do. 


Keep modelling the language you want to hear
To teach a child to talk, we must be constantly teaching what is expected of the child. This must be done in a way that they can understand. You should describe at the language level they are at. Usually, that means just stating things or actions in 1 word. As the child hears the word over and over, at the right context and right timing. S/he will start to pick up how to use the word youâ€™re trying to teach.",90665,1508,0,49

7,K_26L21AmVQ,4/10/2019,Autism Spectrum Disorder - Understanding the Sensory Crisis,"In this video I define autism spectrum disorder and specifically focus on the what you can do about the sensory crisis.

The way we define autism has changed over the years. It began as infantile autism in 1980 and then in 1987 it became pervasive developmental disorder or PDD. Then in 1994 other subtypes were added like Asperger's syndrome which was considered a higher functioning level of autism. Then in 2013, all these terms were incorporated into the new term, autism spectrum disorder. These changes are based on research that increased our understanding of it. 

ASD is a developmental disorder. Meaning it starts in childhood but we no longer have a cut off for when you need to notice the symptoms. If it's very severe you may notice it when the child is a baby but if it a milder form or it may not be noticeable until late grade school or early teen years when the demands of socializing exceeds your ability to adapt.

Autism., Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA), and other neurodiversities are, while widely known, sadly misunderstood. The purpose of this channel is to raise both autism acceptance and awareness by helping to educate with understanding and looking at all facets of autism such as Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD), ADHD, Mental Health, and other related topics.
I am a father to a beautiful autistic and Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) daughter. My channel is very personal and I'm very open about both the joys and  qchallenges of life with a neurodiverse family and parenting Autism and Pathological Demand Avoidance. Thank you for watching!
